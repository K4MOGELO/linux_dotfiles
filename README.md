# My Linux Dotfiles

My Linux dotfiles repository! This repository contains configuration files for various applications and tools that I use on my Linux system.

## Folders

- **i3wm:** Contains my configuration files for the i3 window manager.

  This folder includes configurations for keybindings, workspace layouts, and other settings related to i3wm.

- **lf:** Contains configuration files for the terminal file manager, lf.

  These files customize the appearance and behavior of lf according to my preferences.

- **shell:** Contains my shell configuration files, including `.zshrc` and `.bashrc`.

  These files contain aliases, environment variables, and other customizations for the Zsh and Bash shells.

- **others:** This folder will contain additional configuration files and dotfiles for other applications and tools that I use.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and use these dotfiles as a reference or starting point for your own configurations. However, be cautious when copying configurations directly, as they may contain settings specific to my system or preferences.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions or improvements for any of the configurations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
